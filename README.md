# PartIII RPC Project Tools

## Sections

### Scripts
Includes functions commonly used throughout the analysis, aiding in data manipulation and visualization.

## RPC_Simulation
This segment explores attempts to create simulations on Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) using various geometries.

Hijacked by Tom for area acceptance calculations of Scintillation Counter setup !

## RPC_Leakage_Current_Plotters
Contains miscellaneous tools for the experimental aspect of the project:
- **Plotting and fitting IV curves** for gas gaps.
- **Analysis tools** for SiPMs (Silicon Photomultipliers) and other components.

### Peter's ProANUBIS analsysis

It would be nicer if this was in a separate GitHub repository, thanks.

This is **Peter's (Takodachi6969)** (https://github.com/Takodachi6969) main branch for pro-anubis analysis.

This directory contains:
- **Data:** All relevant datasets used in the analyses.
- **Plots:** Visual representations and results of the data analysis.
- **Code:** Jupyter Notebook files that detail the analysis processes.
