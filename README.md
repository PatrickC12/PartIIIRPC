# PartIIIRPC Project
RPC project GitHub space, store your shit on here.

Todo:

- Error in breakdown_voltage, is it really +/ 3.5 V â€¦.
- Repeat scintillator coincidence w/ OR Logic enable as well. (perhaps we already did this?? No (patrick)
- Compare current densities for mini and massive RPCs.
- Fix floating ground of Large RPC setup. 
- Flip polarity of voltage (if possible?)
- Why are we expecting an exponential fit...
- Try and repeat efficiency measurement produced RPC IV Curve document in literature folder in google drive
- Check gradient of linear regions of plots. Should be consistent across plots. Linear resistance due to spacers in RPC.
- Repeat measurement of N2 with larger RPC (flush for longer!)
