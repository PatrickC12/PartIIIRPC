RPC project GitHub space, store your shit on here.

Todo:

- Error in breakdown_voltage, is it really +/ 3.5 V ….

- Repeat scintillator coincidence w/ OR Logic enable as well. perhaps we already did this?? No, bloody DDoS

- Compare current densities for mini and massive RPCs.

- Fix floating ground of Large RPC setup.

-̶ F̶l̶i̶p̶ p̶o̶l̶a̶r̶i̶t̶y̶ o̶f̶ v̶o̶l̶t̶a̶g̶e̶ (̶i̶f̶ p̶o̶s̶s̶i̶b̶l̶e̶?̶)̶

- Why are we expecting an exponential fit...

- Try and repeat efficiency measurement produced RPC IV Curve document in literature folder in google drive

- Check gradient of linear regions of plots. Should be consistent across plots. Linear resistance due to spacers (and edge) in RPC, as well as gas mixture.

- Repeat measurement of N2 with larger RPC (flush for longer!)

- Put a line @ 690 mV on SiPM count vs threshold to mark regime change
